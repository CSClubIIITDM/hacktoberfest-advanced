# Title:
  ### Longest Similiar Looking Substring
  
# Problem Description:
  You are given a string of binary numbers as input, you need to find the longest substring (i.e., contiguous string (not a subsequence)) which has a property which says the string remains same when it is reversed.
  
# Input:
  The first and only line contains a binary string.
  
# Output:
  Output should contain a binary string which is the longest substring and is a palindrome.<br>
  Note:  If the result has multiple answers , print any answer , all answers which satisfy the condition are accepted
  
# Constraints:
  1 $\le$ Length of string $\leq$ 1000
  
# Sample Test Cases:
  Test Case -1:<br>
  Input:
  ```
  10001001
  ```
  Output:
  ```
  10001 or 00100
  ```

# Rules of submission:
  - Expected time complexity: O(n^2)
  - n is length of string
